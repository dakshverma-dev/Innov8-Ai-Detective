Right. Six years. Absolutely. Well, six if you group internships and tiny consults together. No, actually, three full time. Maybe four counting freelance. So, I led some sprints. I mean I coordinated. Coordinated is different from led. And sometimes I was the only one who merged the final branch. Sorry, that came out awkward.
